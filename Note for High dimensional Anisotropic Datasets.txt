Note for High dimensional Anisotropic Datasets

Datasets are generated by producing isotropic clusters first, then applying a linear transformation on them to make them anisotropic.

anisotropic_high_dimensional_data.csv - moderate skew applied, low standard deviation for the 5 variable density clusters
- Results were identical for HDBSCAN and DBSCAN

anisotropic_high_dimensional_data2.csv - extreme skew applied, high standard deviation for the 5 variable density clusters
- HDBSCAN performed significantly better than DBSCAN, but was hard to visually distinguish the clusters

*anisotropic_high_dimensional_data3.csv - extreme skew applied, moderate-high standard deviation for the 5 variable density clusters
- Meaningful results obtained with appropriate visualisations and HDBSCAN outperforming DBSCAN (0.94 compared to 0.88)

Third one was chosen for our analysis, offering a reasonable, logical blend of parameters and corresponding results.
